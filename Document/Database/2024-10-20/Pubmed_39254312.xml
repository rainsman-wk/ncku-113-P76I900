Currently, there is no specific drug treatment for this virus, and a better understanding of virus-host interaction is crucial for novel antiviral development. Here, we find that the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, VPS34, is an essential host factor for EV71 infection. VPS34 inhibition with either shRNA or specific chemical inhibitor significantly reduces EV71 infection. Meanwhile, EV71 infection upregulates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) production in viral replication organelles (ROs), while the depletion of PI3P by phosphatase overexpression inhibits EV71 infection. In addition, the PI3P-binding protein, double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1), is also required for an efficient replication of EV71. DFCP1 could interact with viral 2C protein and facilitate viral association with lipid droplets (LDs), which are important lipid sources for viral RO biogenesis. Taken together, these results indicate that EV71 virus exploits the VPS34-PI3P-DFCP1-LDs pathway to promote viral RO formation and viral infection, and they also illuminate novel targets for antiviral development.IMPORTANCEEnterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major pathogen that causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and other serious complications, which are big threats to children under 5 years old. Unravelling the interactions between virus and the host cells will open new avenues in antiviral research. Here, we found the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, VPS34, and its effector, double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1), were essential for EV71 infection, both of which could support EV71 viral replication by enhancing the biogenesis of viral replication organelles (ROs). As DFCP1 localizes to lipid droplets, hijacking of these host factors will enable viral utilization of lipids from LDs for the generation of membrane structures during RO biogenesis. In addition, the VPS34 kinase inhibitor was found to be potent against EV71 infection; therefore, this study also brings up a novel target for future anti-EV71 drug development.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wu</LastName><ForeName>Bo</ForeName><Initials>B</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Fan</LastName><ForeName>Tingting</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chen</LastName><ForeName>Xinrui</ForeName><Initials>X</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>He</LastName><ForeName>Yingli</ForeName><Initials>Y</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-6439-012X</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wang</LastName><ForeName>Hongliang</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-3304-2683</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2024</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>10</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>J Virol</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>0113724</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0022-538X</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">VPS34</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">enterovirus</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">lipid droplet</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">phosphatidylinositol</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>10</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>45</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>10</Day><Hour>12</Hour><Minute>45</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2024</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>10</Day><Hour>9</Hour><Minute>3</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">39254312</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1128/jvi.00695-24</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
