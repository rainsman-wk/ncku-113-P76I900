Polioviruses were isolated with GMK-2 cell line from 10% emulsion of the feces and titrated the virus contents in the emulsion of the feces. The isolated viruses were tested the reproductive capacity at 39.0 degrees C and 39.5 degrees C by the plaque method with primary cynomologous monkey kidney cells. Viruses were isolated from the feces during 28 days for type 1, 39 days for type 2 and 36 days for type 3 after primary vaccination, however, only type 1 viruses were isolated during 7 days after secondary vaccination. The multiplication of type 3 viruses in the intestine were increased after diminished the multiplication of type 1 and type 2. In plaque formation capacity at 39.0 degrees C and 39.5 degrees C, the isolates had shown to differ clearly among the types of poliovirus. After primary vaccination, type 1 isolates were not produced the plaques at 39.0 degrees C and 39.5 degrees C. Although type 2 isolates were not formed the plaques until the 14th day at 39.5 degrees C, the plaque formation capacity of the these isolates were increased gradually i.e.; on the 20th day (10(0.88) PFU/ml), the 26th day (10(2.00) PFU/ml) and the 39th day (10(2.63) PFU/ml) at 39.5 degrees C, and all of type 2 isolates tested were showed the plaque formation capacity (10(2.88 approximately 10(3.76) PFU/ml) at 39.0 degrees C. Type 3 isolates were formed plaques at 39.0 degrees C and 39.5 degrees C from the 7th day. After the secondary vaccination, type 1 isolates (7th day) was a little changed them. Neutralizing antibody titers were shown that type 1 was 320, type 2 was 110 and type 3 was 60 after 1 year of the second administration. These titers were closely similar the geometric mean titers of 2 year old babies in Japan.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Morimoto</LastName><ForeName>N</ForeName><Initials>N</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Japan Poliomyelitis Research Institute.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Abe</LastName><ForeName>S</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Hashizume</LastName><ForeName>S</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials></Author></AuthorList><Language>jpn</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D004740">English Abstract</PublicationType><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>Japan</Country><MedlineTA>Kansenshogaku Zasshi</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>0236671</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0387-5911</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><ChemicalList><Chemical><RegistryNumber>0</RegistryNumber><NameOfSubstance UI="D011055">Poliovirus Vaccine, Oral</NameOfSubstance></Chemical></ChemicalList><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><MeshHeadingList><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D006801" MajorTopicYN="N">Humans</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D007422" MajorTopicYN="N">Intestines</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000821" MajorTopicYN="Y">virology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D017955" MajorTopicYN="N">Poliovirus</DescriptorName><QualifierName UI="Q000502" MajorTopicYN="Y">physiology</QualifierName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D011055" MajorTopicYN="Y">Poliovirus Vaccine, Oral</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D014611" MajorTopicYN="Y">Vaccination</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D014779" MajorTopicYN="Y">Virus Replication</DescriptorName></MeshHeading></MeshHeadingList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>1997</Year><Month>4</Month><Day>1</Day></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>1997</Year><Month>4</Month><Day>1</Day><Hour>0</Hour><Minute>1</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>1997</Year><Month>4</Month><Day>1</Day><Hour>0</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">9164084</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.11150/kansenshogakuzasshi1970.71.307</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
