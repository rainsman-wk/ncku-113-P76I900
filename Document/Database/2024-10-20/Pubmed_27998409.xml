The average annual incidence was 458.89/100 000. A total of 11 deaths were caused by the disease, with the average annual mortality rate as 0.07/100 000. Two peaks of incidence were seen, from April to July and from September to November. Age of the patients mainly fell in children aged 5 and below, taking up 95.78% of the total cases. Among all the patients, 1-year-olds presented the highest incidence as 12 881.24/100 000. The reported incidence for males was higher than that in females. There were 4 districts in Haikou city that reported the disease. Residential areas of the patients were scattered around, with a percentage of 79.89%. Spectrums of pathogens that causing the prevalence of HFMD were EV71 type, Cox A16 type and other enteroviruses, which prevailing in turns, since 2011. <b>Conclusions:</b> Haikou city had been an area with high incidence of HFMD. The incidence started to show a rising trend recently. It is suggested that programs as surveillance, case management, health education and comprehensive prevention and control of disease on HFMD targeting on key population should be intensively implemented to reduce the mortality of the disease.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lin</LastName><ForeName>C Y</ForeName><Initials>CY</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Department, Haikou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou 571100, China; Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Monitoring and Early Warning (Haikou) Research Base of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou 571100, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Wang</LastName><ForeName>M C</ForeName><Initials>MC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Department, Haikou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou 571100, China; Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Monitoring and Early Warning (Haikou) Research Base of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Zeng</LastName><ForeName>X P</ForeName><Initials>XP</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Department, Haikou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou 571100, China; Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Monitoring and Early Warning (Haikou) Research Base of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Kuang</LastName><ForeName>S Z</ForeName><Initials>SZ</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Microbial Laboratory, Haikou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou 571100, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lin</LastName><ForeName>X B</ForeName><Initials>XB</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Department, Haikou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Haikou 571100, China.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>chi</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>China</Country><MedlineTA>Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8208604</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0254-6450</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><MeshHeadingList><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D002675" MajorTopicYN="N">Child, Preschool</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D002681" MajorTopicYN="N">China</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D004770" MajorTopicYN="N">Enterovirus</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D005260" MajorTopicYN="N">Female</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D006232" MajorTopicYN="Y">Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D006801" MajorTopicYN="N">Humans</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D015994" MajorTopicYN="N">Incidence</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D007223" MajorTopicYN="N">Infant</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D008297" MajorTopicYN="N">Male</DescriptorName></MeshHeading><MeshHeading><DescriptorName UI="D015995" MajorTopicYN="N">Prevalence</DescriptorName></MeshHeading></MeshHeadingList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2016</Year><Month>12</Month><Day>22</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2016</Year><Month>12</Month><Day>22</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2017</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>26</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">27998409</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2016.12.012</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
